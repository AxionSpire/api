# AxionSpire API
The comprehensive API for the AxionSpire Minecraft server.
Built to work for any Minecraft server, though!

## Development
This API is built using Express. Pull the source code and run `npm run dev` (or the equivalent for your tool).
Then, edit away! Make sure it passes tests, then make a pull request!
This repository is in our OSS Rewards Program! Check out our [OSS Contributor Rewards](https://wiki.axionspire.net/en/Rewards/oss) wiki page to see some cool things you get for helping with development!
