## Supported Versions
We support the most recent version of the software.
Also, we support the last release before a new major version for a month (say, if v2.0.0 was the latest, we also support the latest v1 version and will backport bug fixes).

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report vulnerabilities via email to [security@axionspire.net](mailto:security@axionspire.net) or through GitHub's dedicated method (**NOT using Issues**). Include as detailed of a report as possible.
We will reward researchers in a way outlined in our [OSS Contributor Rewards](https://wiki.axionspire.net/en/Rewards/oss) program, possibly extending to money (though likely it will be in-game rewards, as this is a hobby project).
